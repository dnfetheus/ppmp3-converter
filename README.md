## Description

This repository has some functions (it isn't a library, definitely) that makes you able to open, manipulate and write .ppm files whose type is P3.

I started it for lulz, but I suppose someone else would find it useful (for lulz, study or whatever) then made it public.

## Usage
There's a example of usage [here](./src/main.c).
